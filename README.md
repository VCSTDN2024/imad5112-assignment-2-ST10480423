## Challenges and Learnings 
 
During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including: 
 
1. **Challenge 1**: [review screen I didn't know how king K did it so I had to be creative and do it another way "] 
   - **Solution**: [had to make each and every textview box for every question"] 
    
From these challenge, to think outside the box them using one way to do thinks  
6. Future Enhancements 
---------------------- 
## Future Enhancements 
 
There are several features that could be added in the future, including: 
 
1. **Feature 1**: ["generate questions its own without putting an arrayof."] 
2. **Feature 2**: [ "Integrating with a cloud database for storing user data."]

Why: 
---- 
- The References section is critical for academic work to acknowledge the resources and inspiration used during the project. 
- we take work from other people so have to always give them credit
